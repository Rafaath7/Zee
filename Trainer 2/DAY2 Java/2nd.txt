When you create child class object- super class constructoer is called - This is chaining

private so that child cannot extend the particular variable

Final VARIABLE so that child cannot change values/REASSIGN

Final class- no one can inherit the class properties or the class itself 

Final void loan(){
}
 you can make a method final 


cannot apply private access modifier to class 

only default and public for class - you have to explicitly mention public 

The difference b/w public and default for classes is that in different files when public used it can stil be extended 

scope of default in particular file 

Constructor Overriding not possible in java only overloading possible

to override method the signature must be same but implementation can be different 

Overloading- same 
Overriding- different
